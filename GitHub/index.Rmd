# What is GitHub?

GitHub is a software for version control.

--

**Version control:** A system to manage changes to files in a way that reverting to an old version is quick and easy.

*Write. Scratch that. Rewrite.*

# Why use GitHub?

.pull-left[Instead of saving copies, you make "commit". So, no more files named like
- report-final.pdf
- report-final-final.pdf
- report-v2-final.pdf]

# How to use GitHub with RStudio?

---

# Step 1: Install Git

Go to Terminal and write `which git`

and `git --version` to see Git version

![](terminal-git.png)

If both commands work, jump to next step. If not, install Git.

---

## MacOS

If you don't already have Git installed, writing `git --version` would present you with an offer to install Xcode command line tools. Accept the offer.

## Windows

Install Git for Windows from ["https://gitforwindows.org"](https://gitforwindows.org)

## Linux

Ubuntu or Debian Linux:

```
sudo apt-get install git
```

Fedora or RedHat Linux:

```
sudo yum install git
```

---

# Step 2: Configure Git

We will use `usethis::create_github_token()` function from `usethis` package. Recommended scope is auto-selected. .fn[1] .footnote[[1] If you don't have `usethis` and `gitcreds`, install with `install.packages(c("usethis", "gitcreds"))`]

```
usethis::create_github_token()
```

Copy the generated Personal Access Token (PAT) and leave the browser window open.

Now, open `gitcreds` with 

```
gitcreds::gitcreds_set()
```

and paste your PAT when asked for password.

Go Vols!

# Step 3: Create GitHub Repo

1. On **GitHub.com**, go to your repository
2. Open repo's **Settings**
3. In the "Access" section of the sidebar, click **Collaborators & teams**.
